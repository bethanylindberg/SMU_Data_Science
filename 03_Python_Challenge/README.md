# Python Challenge
This project is an effort to use pure python to solve common business problems with limited imported libraries.

PyBank produces a simple financial analysis over time and produces a .txt write up automatically.

PyBoss reformats employee data quickly that would be cumbersome to complete using only excel. This script also produces a .txt write up on completion but can easily be changed to a .csv file.

PyParagraph executes a text analysis of an input file and produces a word count, approx. sentence count, average letter per paragraph and average sentence length.

PyPoll is an aggregation and summation of 3,521,001 count list of votes to quickly summarize the winner of an election. The length of this list makes it impractical to summarize in excel, but this script handles the job easily.
